# Task 8 – Bank Marketing Prediction using Decision Tree

This project applies a Decision Tree classifier on the Bank Marketing dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal and campaign information.

## Objective
To build a machine learning classification model using Decision Tree algorithm.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Steps Performed
- Loaded Bank Marketing dataset  
- Preprocessed categorical and numerical features  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained Decision Tree classifier  
- Evaluated model performance  

## Output
The model predicts customer subscription outcome and provides accuracy score.
